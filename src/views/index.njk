<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Use this form to generate informational packets for the First-Year Trips bus drivers.
Here you can generate new packets and view existing ones.
To change the information included in the packets, see the relevant pages in the nav bar.

<p>
You can make packets without trip info, but if you want to include the number of people that are
getting on and off at each stop, add some trips on the <a href="/trips">trips page</a>.
